    <h1>Hi, I'm Hafeez!</h1>
    <p>Born in the gracious city of "Suleja", the city that was righteously known as "AbuJa" before the name was borrowed by the Federal Capital Territory, Hafeez's main ambition is to become a Computer Engineer from a very young age.</p>
    <p>Far back as 2003, when most kids don't know how a PC looks like, he was already typing a very beautiful list of his family members on an old HP Pc with a Pentium processor and 128mb of RAM (outdated in today's terms).</p>
    <p>Hafeez is an avid reader of novels that have read over fifty (50) books before graduating from Primary School. He doesn't go anywhere without a book stocked to the pockets of his shorts. The tradition continued upto Tertiary institution where he helps others become fluent in the English Language.</p>
    <p>His first encounter with the internet was in 2009 when he escorted a friend to a cybercafe to check Football news and watch some highlights. That first glimpse of <a href="https://www.tribalfootball.com/">Tribalfootball.com</a> and <a href="https://www.goal.com/">goal.com</a> sparked an obsession far greater than the one he has with his books. This encounter contributed immensely towards his ambition to become a Computer Engineer.
    </p>
    <p>Hafeez currently works as a teacher in two public schools; a primary and a secondary school in Niger State of Nigeria. He teaches Primary school Mathematics and Basic Technology for Junior Secondary school.</p>
